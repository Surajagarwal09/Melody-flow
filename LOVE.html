        Damn, love or lust
        Damn, all of us
        
        Give me a run for my money
        There is nobody, no one to outrun me (another world premiere)
        So give me a run for my money
        Sippin' bubbly, feelin' lovely
        Livin' lovely
        Just love me
        I wanna be with you, ayy (just love me), I wanna be with (just love me, just love)
        I wanna be with you, ayy (love me), I wanna be with
        I wanna be with you (love me, just love me)
        
        If I didn't ride blade on curb, would you still (love me)?
        If I minimized my net worth, would you still (love me)?
        Keep it a hundred, I'd rather you trust me than to (love me)
        Keep it a whole one hund', don't got you I got nothin', ayy
        
        I got somethin', ayy (I got somethin')
        Hol' up, we gon' function, ayy (we gon' function)
        No assumptions, ayy (no assumptions)
        Feelin' like Tyson wit' it (feelin' like Tyson wit' it)
        Knock it out twice, I'm wit' it (knock it out twice, I'm wit' it)
        Only for the night, I'm kiddin' (only for the night, I'm kiddin')
        Only for life, yeah, homie for life, yeah
        
        Only for life, let's get it
        Hit that shoulder lean
        I know what comin' over me
        Backstroke oversea
        I know what you need
        Already on ten, all money come in
        All feelin' go out, this feelin' don't drought
        This party won't end
       
        If I didn't ride blade on curb, would you still (love me)?
        If I minimized my net worth, would you still (love me)?
        Keep it a hundred, I'd rather you trust me than to (love me)
        Keep it a whole one hund', don't got you I got nothin' (oh, oh)
        
        Give me a run for my money
        There is nobody, no one to outrun me
        So give me a run for my money
        Sippin' bubbly, feelin' lovely
        Livin' lovely
        Just love me
        I wanna be with you, ayy (just love me), I wanna be with (just love me, just love)

        I'm on the way
        We ain't got no time to waste
        Poppin' your gum on the way (love me)
        Am I in the way?
        I don't wan' pressure you none
        I want your blessin' today (love me)
        Oh, by the way, open the door by the way
        Told you that I'm on the way (love me)
        I'm on the way, I know connection is vague
        Pick up the phone for me, babe (love me)
        
        Dammit, we jammin'
        Bad attitude from yo' nanny
        Curves and your hips from yo' mammy
        Remember Gardena? I took the studio Camry
        I know Top will be mad at me
        I had to do it, I want your body, your music
        I bought the big one to prove it
        Look what you made
        Told you that I'm on the way
        I'm like an exit away, yep
        
        If I didn't ride blade on curb, would you still (love me)?
        If I minimized my net worth, would you still (love me)?
        Keep it a hundred, I'd rather you trust me than to (love me)
        Keep it a whole one hund', don't got you I got nothin' (oh, oh)
        
        Give me a run for my money
        There is nobody, no one to outrun me
        So give me a run for my money
        Sippin' bubbly, feelin' lovely
        Livin' lovely
        Just love me
        I wanna be with you, ayy (just love me), I wanna be with (just love me, just love)
        I wanna be with you, ayy (love me), I wanna be with
