    <pre class="lyricscontent">
        Took you like a shot
        Thought that I could chase you with a cold evening
        Let a couple years water down how I'm feeling about you
        And every time we talk
        Every single word builds up to this moment
        And I gotta convince myself I don't want it
        Even though I do (Even though I do)

        You could break my heart in two
        But when it heals, it beats for you
        I know it's forward, but it's true

        I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to
        When I'm lying close to someone else
        You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it
        If I could do it all again
        I know I'd go back to you
        I know I'd go back to you
        I know I'd go back to you

        We never got it right
        Playing and replaying old conversations
        Overthinking every word and I hate it
        'Cause it's not me
        And what's the point in hiding?
        Everybody knows we got unfinished business
        And I'll regret it if I didn't say
        This isn't what it could be (Isn't what it could be)
        
        You could break my heart in two
        But when it heals, it beats for you
        I know it's forward, but it's true
        
        I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to
        When I'm lying close to someone else
        You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it
        If I could do it all again
        I know I'd go back to you
        I know I'd go back to you
        I know I'd go back to you
        I'd go back to you, I'd go back to you
        What was there wasn't sure
        But I'd go back to you (I know I'd go back to you)
        
        You can break my heart in two
        But when it heals, it beats for you
        I know it's forward, but it's true
        Won't lie, I'd go back to you
       
        You know, my thoughts are running loose
        It's just a thing you make me do
        And I could fight, but what's the use?
        I know I'd go back to you
        
        I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to (When I'm not supposed to)
        When I'm lying close to someone else
        You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it
        If I could do it all again
        I know I'd go back to you
       
        I'd go back to you
        I'd go back to you
        I know I'd go back to you
        I'd go back to you, I'd go back to you
        I know I'd go back to you</pre>
