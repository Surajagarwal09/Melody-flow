    <pre class="lyricscontent">
        You promised the world and I fell for it
        I put you first and you adored it
        Set fires to my forest
        And you let it burn
        Sang off-key in my chorus
        'Cause it wasn't yours

        I saw the signs and I ignored it
        Rose-colored glasses all distorted
        Set fire to my purpose
        And I let it burn
        You got off on the hurtin'
        When it wasn't yours, yeah

        We'd always go into it blindly
        I needed to lose you to find me
        This dancing was killing me softly
        I needed to hate you to love me, yeah

        To love, love, yeah
        To love, love, yeah
        To love, yeah
        I needed to lose you to love me, yeah
        To love, love, yeah
        To love, love, yeah
        To love, yeah
        I needed to lose you to love me

        I gave my all and they all know it
        Then you tore me down and now it's showing
        In two months, you replaced us
        Like it was easy
        Made me think I deserved it
        In the thick of healing, yeah

        We'd always go into it blindly
        I needed to lose you to find me
        This dancing was killing me softly
        I needed to hate you to love me, yeah

        To love, love, yeah
        To love, love, yeah
        To love, yeah
        I needed to lose you to love me, yeah
        To love, love, yeah
        To love, love, yeah
        To love, yeah
        I needed to lose you to love me

        You promised the world and I fell for it
        I put you first and you adored it
        Set fires to my forest
        And you let it burn
        Sang off-key in my chorus

        To love, love, yeah
        To love, love, yeah
        To love, yeah
        I needed to hate you to love me, yeah
        To love, love, yeah
        To love, love, yeah
        To love, yeah
        I needed to lose you to love me

        To love, love, yeah
        To love, love, yeah
        To love, yeah

        And now the chapter is closed and done
        To love, love, yeah
        To love, love, yeah
        To love, yeah
        And now it's goodbye, it's goodbye for us</pre>
