        I had a dream we were sippin' whiskey neat
        Highest floor, The Bowery, nowhere's high enough
        Somewhere along the lines we stopped seein' eye to eye
        You were stayin' out all night and I had enough
        
        No, I don't wanna know where you been or where you're goin'
        But I know I won't be home, and you'll be on your own
        
        Who's gonna walk you through the dark side of the mornin'?
        Who's gonna rock you when the sun won't let you sleep?
        Who's wakin' up to drive you home when you're drunk and all alone?
        Who's gonna walk you through the dark side of the mornin'?
        
        It ain't me (The Bowery)
        (Whiskey neat, grateful, I'm so grateful, I)
        It ain't me (The Bowery)
        (Whiskey neat, grateful, I'm so grateful, I)
        
        It ain't me (The Bowery)
        
        (Whiskey neat, grateful, I'm so grateful, I)
        It ain't me (The Bowery)
        (Whiskey neat, grateful, I'm so grateful, I)
        It ain't me
        
        I had a dream, we were back to 17
        Summer nights and The Libertines, never growin' up
        I'll take with me the Polaroids and the memories
        But you know I'm gonna leave behind the worst of us
        
        Who's gonna walk you through the dark side of the mornin'?
        Who's gonna rock you when the sun won't let you sleep?
        Who's wakin' up to drive you home when you're drunk and all alone?
        Who's gonna walk you through the dark side of the mornin'?
        
        It ain't me, no, no
        It ain't me, no, no
        It ain't me, no, no
        Who's gonna walk you through the dark side of the mornin'?
        
        It ain't me (The Bowery)
        (Whiskey neat, grateful, I'm so grateful, I)
        It ain't me (The Bowery)
        It ain't me (grateful, I'm so grateful, I)
        
        Ah, ooh (The Bowery)
        Ah, ooh (whiskey neat, grateful, I'm so grateful, I)
        Ah, ooh (it ain't me, The Bowery)
        Ah, oh (whiskey neat, grateful, I'm so grateful, I)
        
        It ain't me (The Bowery)
        (Whiskey neat, grateful, I'm so grateful, I)
        It ain't me, na, na, na, na-na, The Bowery
        Na, na, na, na-na, whiskey neat (grateful, I'm so grateful, I)
        
        It ain't me</pre>
