        Nobody pray for me
        It been that day for me
        Way (yeah, yeah!)
        
        Ayy, I remember syrup sandwiches and crime allowances
        Finesse a nigga with some counterfeits, but now I'm countin' this
        Parmesan where my accountant lives; in fact, I'm downin' this
        D'USSÃ‰ with my boo bae tastes like Kool-Aid for the analysts
        
        Girl, I can buy yo' ass the world with my paystub
        Ooh, that pussy good, won't you sit it on my taste buds?
        I get way too petty once you let me do the extras
        Pull up on your block, then break it down, we playin' Tetris
        
        A.m. to the p.m., p.m. to the a.m., funk
        Piss out your per diem, you just gotta hate 'em, funk
        If I quit your BM, I still ride Mercedes, funk
        If I quit this season, I still be the greatest, funk
        
        My left stroke just went viral
        Right stroke put lil' baby in a spiral
        Soprano C, we like to keep it on a high note
        It's levels to it, you and I know
        
        Bitch, be humble (hol' up, bitch)
        Sit down (hol' up, lil', hol' up, lil' bitch)
        Be humble (hol' up, bitch)
        Sit down (hol' up, sit down, lil', sit down, lil' bitch)
        
        Be humble (hol' up, hol' up)
        Bitch, sit down (hol' up, hol' up, lil' bitch)
        Be humble (lil' bitch, hol' up, bitch)
        Sit down (hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up)
        
        Be humble (hol' up, hol' up)
        Sit down (hol' up, hol' up, lil', hol' up, lil' bitch)
        Be humble (hol' up, bitch)
        Sit down (hol' up, sit down, lil', sit down, lil' bitch)
        
        Be humble (hol' up, hol' up)
        Bitch, sit down (hol' up, hol' up, lil' bitch)
        Be humble (lil' bitch, hol' up, bitch)
        Sit down (hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up)
        
        Who dat nigga thinkin' that he frontin' on Man-Man?
        Get the fuck off my stage, I'm the Sandman (Sandman)
        Get the fuck off my dick, that ain't right
        I make a play fucking up your whole life
        
        I'm so fuckin' sick and tired of the Photoshop
        Show me somethin' natural like afro on Richard Pryor
        Show me somethin' natural like ass with some stretch marks
        Still will take you down right on your mama's couch in Polo socks
        
        Ayy, this shit way too crazy, ayy, you do not amaze me, ayy
        I blew cool from AC, ayy, Obama just paged me, ayy
        I don't fabricate it, ayy, most of y'all be fakin', ayy
        I stay modest 'bout it, ayy, she elaborate it, ayy
        
        This that Grey Poupon, that Evian, that TED Talk, ayy
        Watch my soul speak, you let the meds talk, ayy
        If I kill a nigga, it won't be the alcohol, ayy
        I'm the realest nigga after all
        
        Bitch, be humble (hol' up, bitch)
        Sit down (hol' up, lil', hol' up, lil' bitch)
        Be humble (hol' up, bitch)
        Sit down (hol' up, sit down, lil', sit down, lil' bitch)
        
        Be humble (hol' up, hol' up)
        Bitch, sit down (hol' up, hol' up, lil' bitch)
        Be humble (lil' bitch, hol' up, bitch)
        Sit down (hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up)
        
        Be humble (hol' up, hol' up)
        Sit down (hol' up, hol' up, lil', hol' up, lil' bitch)
        Be humble (hol' up, bitch)
        Sit down (hol' up, sit down, lil', sit down, lil' bitch)
        
        Be humble (hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up)
        Bitch, sit down (hol' up, hol' up, lil' bitch)
        Be humble (lil' bitch, hol' up, bitch)
        Sit down (hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up)</pre>
