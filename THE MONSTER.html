        I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
        Get along with the voices inside of my head
        You're tryin' to save me, stop holding your breath
        And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy (crazy)
        
        I wanted the fame but not the cover of Newsweek
        Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey
        Wanted to receive attention for my music
        Wanted to be left alone in public, excuse me
        For wantin' my cake, and eat it too, and wantin' it both ways
        Fame made me a balloon 'cause my ego inflated
        When I blew, see, but it was confusing
        'Cause all I wanted to do's be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
        Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam (ooh)
        Hit the lottery, ooh-wee
        But with what I gave up to get, it was bittersweet
        It was like winnin' a used mink
        Ironic 'cause I think I'm gettin' so huge I need a shrink
        I'm beginnin' to lose sleep, one sheep, two sheep
        Going coo-coo and kooky as Kool Keith
        But I'm actually weirder than you think, 'cause I'm
       
        I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
        Get along with the voices inside of my head
        You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
        And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
        
        Well, that's nothin' (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
        (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
        Well, that's nothin' (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
        (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
        
        Now, I ain't much of a poet
        But I know somebody once told me to seize the moment
        And don't squander it
        'Cause you never know when it all could be over tomorrow
        So I keep conjurin'
        Sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
        Yeah, ponderin'll do you wonders
        No wonder you're losing your mind, the way it wanders
        Yodel-odel-ay-hee-hoo
        I think it went wanderin' off down yonder
        And stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen
        'Cause I need an interventionist
        To intervene between me and this monster
        And save me from myself and all this conflict
        'Cause the very thing that I love's killing me
        And I can't conquer it
        My OCD is conkin' me in the head, keep knockin'
        Nobody's home, I'm sleepwalkin'
        I'm just relayin' what the voice in my head's sayin'
        Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the
        
        I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
        Get along with the voices inside of my head
        You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
        And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
        Well, that's nothin' (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
        (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
        Well, that's nothin' (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
        (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
        
        Call me crazy, but I have this vision
        One day that I'll walk amongst you a regular civilian
        But until then, drums get killed and
        I'm comin' straight at MC's, blood gets spilled and
        I'll take it back to the days that I'd get on a Dre track
        Give every kid who got played that pumped-up feelin'
        And shit to say back to the kids who played him
        I ain't here to save the fuckin' children
        But if one kid out of a hundred million
        Who are going through a struggle feels it and relates, that's great
        It's payback, Russell Wilson
        Falling way back in the draft
        Turn nothin' into somethin', still can
        Make that, straw into gold, chump, I will spin
        Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack
        Maybe I need a straight jacket, face facts
        I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that
        It's nothin', I'm still friends with the
        
        I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
        Get along with the voices inside of my head
        You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
        And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
        
        I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
        Get along with the voices inside of my head
        You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
        And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
        
        Well, that's nothin' (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
        (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
        Well, that's nothin' (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
        (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)</pre>
