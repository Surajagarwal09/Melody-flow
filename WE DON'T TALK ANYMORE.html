        We don't talk anymore
        We don't talk anymore
        We don't talk anymore
        Like we used to do
        We don't love anymore
        What was all of it for?
        Oh, we don't talk anymore
        Like we used to do

        I just heard you found the one you've been looking
        You've been looking for
        I wish I would have known that wasn't me
        'Cause even after all this time I still wonder
        Why I can't move on
        Just the way you did so easily?

        Don't wanna know
        What kind of dress you're wearing tonight
        If he's holding onto you so tight
        The way I did before
        I overdosed
        Should've known your love was a game
        Now I can't get you out of my brain
        Oh, it's such a shame
        
        That we don't talk anymore
        We don't talk anymore
        We don't talk anymore
        Like we used to do
        We don't love anymore
        What was all of it for?
        Oh, we don't talk anymore
        Like we used to do

        I just hope you're lying next to somebody
        Who knows how to love you like me
        There must be a good reason that you're gone
        Every now and then I think you
        Might want me to come show up at your door
        But I'm just too afraid that I'll be wrong
        
        Don't wanna know
        If you're looking into her eyes
        If she's holding onto you so tight
        The way I did before
        I overdosed
        Should've known your love was a game
        Now I can't get you out of my brain
        Ooh, it's such a shame

        That we don't talk anymore (we don't, we don't)
        We don't talk anymore (we don't, we don't)
        We don't talk anymore
        Like we used to do
        We don't love anymore (we don't, we don't)
        What was all of it for? (We don't, we don't)
        Oh, we don't talk anymore
        Like we used to do

        Like we used to do

        Don't wanna know
        What kind of dress you're wearing tonight
        If he's giving it to you just right
        The way I did before
        I overdosed
        Should've known your love was a game
        Now I can't get you out of my brain
        Oh, it's such a shame

        That we don't talk anymore (we don't, we don't)
        We don't talk anymore (we don't, we don't)
        We don't talk anymore
        Like we used to do
        We don't love anymore (we don't, we don't)
        What was all of it for? (we don't, we don't)
        Oh, we don't talk anymore
        Like we used to do
        
        (We don't talk anymore) Don't wanna know
        What kind of dress you're wearing tonight (oh)
        If he's holding onto you so tight (oh)
        The way I did before
        (We don't talk anymore) I overdosed
        Should've known your love was a game (oh)
        Now I can't get you out of my brain (woah)
        Ooh, it's such a shame
        We don't talk anymore</pre>
