    <pre class="lyricscontent">
        In your eyes, there's a heavy blue
        One to love, and one to lose
        Sweet divine, a heavy truth
        Water or wine, don't make me choose

        I wanna feel the way that we did that summer night, night
        Drunk on a feeling, alone with the stars in the sky

        I've been running through the jungle
        I've been running with the wolves
        To get to you, to get to you
        I've been down the darkest alleys
        Saw the dark side of the moon
        To get to you, to get to you
        
        I've looked for love in every stranger
        Took too much to ease the anger
        All for you, yeah, all for you
        I've been running through the jungle
        I've been crying with the wolves
        To get to you, to get to you, to get to you
        
        To get to you
        
        To get to you
        
        Your fingertips trace my skin
        To places I have never been
        Blindly, I am following
        Break down these walls and come on in
        
        I wanna feel the way that we did that summer night, night
        Drunk on a feeling, alone with the stars in the sky
        
        I've been running through the jungle
        I've been running with the wolves
        To get to you, to get to you
        I've been down the darkest alleys
        Saw the dark side of the moon
        To get to you, to get to you
        
        I've looked for love in every stranger
        Took too much to ease the anger
        All for you, yeah, all for you
        I've been running through the jungle
        I've been crying with the wolves
        To get to you, to get to you, to get to you
        
        To get to you
        
        To get to you
        
        I've been running through the jungle
        I've been running with the wolves
        To get to you, to get to you
        I've been down the darkest alleys
        Saw the dark side of the moon
        To get to you, to get to you
        
        I've looked for love in every stranger
        Took too much to ease the anger
        All for you, yeah, all for you
        I've been running through the jungle
        I've been crying with the wolves
        To get to you, to get to you, to get to you</pre>
