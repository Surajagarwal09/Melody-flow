Love, let's talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
Or do the feeling haunt you?
I know the feeling haunt you

This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer

This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer

Tell me what you gon' do to me
Confrontation ain't nothin' new to me
You can bring a bullet, bring a sword
Bring a morgue, but you can't bring the truth to me

Fuck you and all your expectations
I don't even want your congratulations
I recognize your false confidence
And calculated promises all in your conversation

I hate people that feel entitled
Look at me crazy 'cause I ain't invite you
Oh, you important?
You the moral to the story you endorsin'?
Motherfucker, I don't even like you

Corrupt a man's heart with a gift
That's how you find out who you dealin' with
A small percentage who I'm buildin' with
I want the credit if I'm losin' or I'm winnin'
On my momma, that's the realest shit

Love, let's talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
Or do the feeling haunt you?
I know the feeling haunt you

This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer

This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer

Skin covered in ego
Get to talkin', I get involved, like a rebound
Got no end game, got no result, got to stay down
It's the way that you making me feel like nobody ever loved me
Like you do, you do
You kinda feel like you tryin' to get away from me
If you do, I won't move

I just cry for no reason (reason), I just pray for no reason (reason)
I give thanks for the day
For the hours and another way, another life breathin'
I did it all 'cause it feel good
But wouldn't do it all if it feel bad
Better live your life
We are running out of time

Love, let's talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
Or do the feeling haunt you?
I know the feeling haunt you

This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer

This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer</pre>
