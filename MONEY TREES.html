    <pre class="lyricscontent">
        Uh, me and my niggas tryna get it, ya bish (ya bish)
        Hit the house lick, tell me is you wit' it, ya bish? (Ya bish)
        Home invasion was persuasive (was persuasive)
        From nine-to-five I know it's vacant, ya bish (ya bish)
        Dreams of living life like rappers do (like rappers do)
        Back when condom wrappers wasn't cool (they wasn't cool)
        I fucked Sherane and went to tell my bros (tell my bros)
        Then Usher Raymond "Let It Burn" came on ("Let Burn" came on)
        
        Hot sauce all in our Top Ramen, ya bish (ya bish)
        Park the car then we start rhyming, ya bish (ya bish)
        The only thing we had to free our mind (free our mind)
        Then freeze that verse when we see dollar signs (see dollar signs)
        You looking like an easy come up, ya bish (ya bish)
        A silver spoon I know you come from, ya bish (ya bish)
        And that's a lifestyle that we never knew (we never knew)
        Go at a reverend for the revenue
        
        It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
        Pick your poison, tell me what you doing
        Everybody gon' respect the shooter
        But the one in front of the gun lives forever
        (The one in front of the gun, forever)
        And I been hustling all day, this-a-way, that-a-way
        Through canals and alleyways, just to say
        Money trees is the perfect place for shade and that's just how I feel
        
        Nah, nah, a dollar might just fuck your main bitch, that's just how I feel
        Nah, a dollar might say fuck them niggas that you came with, that's just how I feel
        Nah, nah, a dollar might just make that lane switch, that's just how I feel
        Nah, a dollar might turn to a million and we all rich, that's just how I feel
        
        Dreams of living life like rappers do (like rappers do)
        Bump that new E-40 after school (way after school)
        You know "Big Ballin' With My Homies" (my homies)
        Earl Stevens had us thinkin' rational (thinkin' rational)
        Back to reality, we poor, ya bish (ya bish)
        Another casualty at war, ya bish (ya bish)
        Two bullets in my Uncle Tony head (my Tony head)
        He said one day I'll be on tour, ya bish (ya bish)
        
        That Louis Burgers never be the same (won't be the same)
        A Louis belt will never ease that pain (won't ease that pain)
        But I'ma purchase when that day is jerkin' (that day is jerkin')
        Pull off at Church's with Pirellis skirtin' (Pirellis skirtin')
        Gang signs out the window, ya bish (ya bish)
        Hoping all of them offend you, ya bish (ya bish)
        They say your hood is a pot of gold (pot of gold)
        And we gon' crash it when nobody's home
        
        It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
        Pick your poison, tell me what you doing
        Everybody gon' respect the shooter
        But the one in front of the gun lives forever
        (The one in front of the gun, forever)
        And I been hustling all day, this-a-way, that-a-way
        Through canals and alleyways, just to say
        Money trees is the perfect place for shade and that's just how I feel
        
        Nah, nah, a dollar might just fuck your main bitch, that's just how I feel
        Nah, a dollar might say fuck them niggas that you came with, that's just how I feel
        Nah, nah, a dollar might just make that lane switch, that's just how I feel
        Nah, a dollar might turn to a million and we all rich, that's just how I feel
        
        Be the last one out to get this dough? No way
        Love one of you bucket-headed hoes? No way
        Hit the streets, then we break the code? No way
        Hit the brakes when they on patrol? No way

        'Magine Rock up in them projects where them niggas pick your pockets
        Santa Claus don't miss them stockings, liquor spillin', pistols popping
        Baking soda YOLA whipping ain't no turkey on Thanksgivin'
        My homeboy just domed a nigga, I just hope the Lord forgive him
        Pots with cocaine residue, every day I'm hustlin'
        What else is a thug to do when you eatin' cheese from the government?
        Gotta provide for my daughter n'em, get the fuck up out my way, bitch
        Got that drum and I got them bands just like a parade, bitch
        
        Drop that work up in the bushes, hope them boys don't see my stash
        If they do, tell the truth, this the last time you might see my ass
        From the gardens where the grass ain't cut, them serpents lurking, blood
        Bitches selling pussy, niggas selling drugs, but it's all good
        Broken promises, steal your watch and tell you what time it is
        Take your J's and tell you to kick it where a Foot Locker is
        In the streets with a heater under my Dungarees
        Dreams of me getting shaded under a money tree
        
        It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
        Pick your poison, tell me what you doing
        Everybody gon' respect the shooter
        But the one in front of the gun lives forever
        (The one in front of the gun, forever)
        And I been hustling all day, this-a-way, that-a-way
        Through canals and alleyways, just to say
        Money trees is the perfect place for shade and that's just how I feel
        
        Kendrick, just bring my car back man, I called in for another appointment
        I figured you weren't gonna be back here on time anyways
        Look, shit, shit, I just wanna get out the house man
        This man's on one, he feeling good than a motherfucker
        Shit, I'm tryna get my thing going too, just bring my car back (girl, I want your body, I want your body)
        Shit, he faded, he feeling good, look, listen to him ('cause you got a big ol' fat ass)
        Girl, girl, I want your body, I want your body, 'cause of that big ol' fat ass
        See he high as hell, shit, he ain't even trippin' off them
        Damn dominoes no more (girl, I want your body, 'cause of that big ol-)
        Just bring the car back
        Did somebody say dominoes?</pre>
